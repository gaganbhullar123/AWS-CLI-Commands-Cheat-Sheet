https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-set-and-list-environment-variables-in-linux/#:~:text=The%20most%20used%20command%20to,variables%2C%20one%20variable%20per%20line.

The above link explains the difference between environment variables and shell variables.

Using curl command how to set the availability zone which is AZ(environment variable) and AWS_DEFAULT_REGION(environmet variable).

2. # Set the Region
AZ=`curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone`
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=${AZ::-1}

In the above command the curl command is inside the backtick(`) which means the content inside will run as a command and then the result will be 
assigned to AZ and also export command is used to assign the values to environment variable. In AZ the last letter is truncated.
For Example if the AZ is ap-southeast-2a. Then, the region would be ap-southeast-2.


3. # Obtain the Linux AMI
AMI=$(aws ssm get-parameters --names /aws/service/ami-amazon-linux-latest/amzn2-ami-hvm-x86_64-gp2 --query 'Parameters[0].[Value]' --output text)
echo $AMI
ssm is aws system manager
Remember: This command will not work If the region is not set. So make sure the region is set using command in step 2.
Also to run the command the shell must be configured using aws configure command.

4. # Obtain a subnet
SUBNET=$(aws ec2 describe-subnets --filters 'Name=tag:Name,Values=Mysubnet1' --query Subnets[].SubnetId --output text)
echo $SUBNET

The above command is used to obtain the subnet id. 
--filters is used to filter the result based on the value provided. For example in this case subnet id for Mysubnet1 is searched.

5. # Obtain the security group to use.
SG=$(aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=group-name,Values=MySecurityGroup --query SecurityGroups[].GroupId --output text)
echo $SG
The above command is used to get the security group.
